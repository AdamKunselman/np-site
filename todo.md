## Project To-Do's

#### Front-end

#### Back-end

#### Image Handling

- Consider implementing tiny blurring image loading technique

- Rather than using a default image for parks with no image, just use a grey background with text that says 'No Image'

#### Admin

- Write documentation for api requests

#### Testing

- Add a testing framework (maybe Jasmine)

- Build integration test for each park page

- Build integration test for each park category

- Build integration test for each park list

#### Bugs!

- Parks with '&' in the name return 404 requests when loading park page

- Some parks do not have a state associated with them for some reason. Might need to adjust this in the db seeding function
