## Project To-Do's

#### Front-end

- Create _'/about'_ page

- Create _'/tos'_ page

- Create _'/privacy'_ page

- Add comprehensive error handling throughout front-end

#### Back-end

- Create _'/about'_ route/controller

- Create _'/tos'_ route/controller

- Create _'/privacy'_ route/controller

- Add comprehensive error handling throughout back-end

#### Image Handling

- Consider implementing tiny blurring image loading technique

- Rather than using a default image for parks with no image, just use a grey background with text that says 'No Image'

#### Admin

- Generate TOS and populate related pages

- Generate Privacy Policy and populate related pages

- Write documentation for api requests

#### Bugs!

- Parks with '&' in the name return 404 requests when loading park page

- Some parks do not have a state associated with them for some reason. Might need to adjust this in the db seeding function
